# Gaussian Process Linking Functions for Mind, Brain, and Behavior

This repository provides codes and data used for "Gaussian Process Linking Functions for Mind, Brain, and Behavior" (Bahg, Evans, Galdo, & Turner, in press, PNAS).

 * simulation: The code used for the simulated study on a spatiotemporal GPJM.
 * fMRI_data: Raw fMRI data and general linear model regressors.
 * fMRI_model: The code of the GPJM with three-dimensional latent dynamics. Includes pre-processed data files used for fitting the model.
